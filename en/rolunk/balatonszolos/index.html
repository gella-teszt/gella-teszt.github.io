<p>Balatonszőlős is situated behind the Tihany peninsula, about 6 km from Lake Balaton, in the eastern part of the so-called Pécsely - vineyard basin. It was first mentioned authentically in 1121. Its currently used name is read for the first time in 1758.</p>

<p>The earliest traces of resettlement can be found throughout the territory of Balatonszőlős. The most ancient settlement remains known from the New Stone period (B.C. 3-4th century) are derived. Along the highway leading to Pécsely, traces of a Roman farm were found at the end of the 19th century. The excavation of Viktor Récsey in 1891 was confirmed by specialists of the Veszprém museum in 1961.</p>

<p>After the vague period of the 6-7th century, the settlement of the Avars in the 8-9th century is the next stable point in the history of Szőlős. South of the village in 1963, the remains of the late Avar-era cemetery and the cemetery were registered by archaeologists.</p>

<h2 id="the-medieval-vineyards">The medieval vineyards</h2>

<p>Unfortunately, we do not know which genus invaded this land at the time of the conquest. However, it is certain that in the 9-13th century — like the whole Lake Balaton region — Szőlős was a royal estate. From 1211 it was the property of Tihany Abbey, then from 1222 it was the estate of the Veszprém campus.</p>

<p>The medieval Szőlős (10-13th century) stood roughly on the site of today&rsquo;s settlement. According to archaeologists, the Tó Hill settlements dates from the late Avar-era (8-9th century).</p>

<p>During the 11th and 13th century &ldquo;donations and possessions&rdquo;, the population cultivating the estate originally owned by the unified royal property was slowly divided into parts. After the final dissolution of the royal possession - by the beginning of the 14th century - the centre of the Balatonszőlős village, the landlord estates were located in the following directions and surrounded the settlement. The estates of Tihany Abbey were located in the northeast direction. South of this direction, in the direction of Balatonfüred - in the area of Győr Hill - the Cistercita Abbey of Zirc was a proprietor. Further south - to Lake Balaton - had estates in Fehérvár. In this area - to the south of Győr Hill, private estates (son of Peter Sebestyén) and the lands of the Abbey of Zalavar, while to the west of the hill there were partly private estates (lands of the sons of Ispan Arnold and Valpod), as well as the estates of Dénes and the Abbey of Alma. The estates of the campus of Veszprém were located south-west of the present village. To the south of this time, it was formerly the lands of the Lord Ruska, which then became the possession of the Russian hermitage, subordinated to the abbey of Tihany.”
Therefore, in addition to a number of small lords, the two most significant landlords in Veszprém were the chapel and Tihany Abbey.</p>

<h2 id="the-time-of-turkish-occupation">The time of Turkish occupation</h2>

<p>The year of the castle wars did not escape Veszprém and its surroundings. In 1552, after the Turkish occupation of the Veszprém Castle, the royal command began to modernize and fortify Vázsonykő and Tihany to protect the countryside. Accordingly, the population of the surrounding villages - as well as the vineyards - worked on Tihany fortification works within the framework of the mandatory fortress robot.</p>

<p>Despite the fact that the Hungarians took back the castle of Veszprém in 1566, the Turks still did not give up this area. The vineyards therefore continued to pay the Turkish tax (also). In the rest of the 16th century, the area is characterized by killing, escaping and misery. In the 16th and 17th centuries, even in the first two decades of the 18th century, there were several times depopulation of the Szőlős.</p>

<h2 id="the-18th-century-village">The 18th century village</h2>

<p>The Rákóczi War of Independence following the Turkish wars avoided vineyards and its countryside. However, despite all this, after the Turkish and kuruc fights, even in medieval terms, the population was very sparse.
In the middle of the 18th century, the inhabitants of the vineyards - both landowners and serfs - increased their vineyards, mainly in the form of extermination fields.
According to the Habsburg economic policy of the 1750s, German settlers arrived in this part of Transdanubia as well. In 1755, Swabians settled in Holdkút appeared in Vines to cultivate vineyards on the Little Vineyards hill.</p>

<h2 id="the-1848-49-war-of-independence-and-the-post-compromise-period">The 1848-49 War of Independence and the post-Compromise period</h2>

<p>The 1848-49 Revolution and War of Independence found patriots in Balatonszőlős who voluntarily went to war for the country. Fourteen brave men, in the fall of 1848, joined the Army Battalions 47 and 56 in Zala. The military events of the War of Independence did not affect the area or the village.
 In the course of 1856-57, the Habsburg ruling house implemented its ideas for land management in Vines. Accordingly, from the mid-1860s, private peasant small farms became dominant in the village. Another significant change was caused by the great phylloxera fest of 1890-93, as the entire vineyard of the village was destroyed. Among other things, this justifies the reduction of the large population of Lesser Vines and the significant financial problems of the population. Since 1894, new varieties were planted to replace the extinct vineyards.</p>

<h2 id="the-20th-century-balatonszőlős">The 20th century Balatonszőlős</h2>

<p>As a result of the large national census of 1910, outside the village population, the area of the entire border of the village was census, which was 2228 cadastral acres at that time. The population was 386, of which 192 were men and 194 were women. On the eve of the First World War, the military men of the settlement entered the 20th Hungarian royal infantry regiment of Nagykanizsa. Compared to the number of vineyards, the war claimed significant casualties, because 19 men died heroic deaths between 1914 and 1918. On December 16, 1926, a memorial plaque was placed on the wall of the Reformed Church.</p>

<p>The period between the two world wars had two distinctive spots in Vynov: folk acting and the municipal firefighting association. In the early 1920s the village boasted a songwriter.
The Second World War arrived in the settlement only when it was mobilised in February and March 1942. Military men&rsquo;s armies were mostly deployed to the Eastern Front with 4/III and 34/III Battalions of Veszprém, part of the 4th Army of Sopron, under the subordination of the 2nd Hungarian Army. Most of the vineyards died during the bridge battles in the Don and during the breakthrough in Uriv. German troops entered the village around 8-10 in the morning of March 25, 1945 and evacuated it at 20 o&rsquo;clock in the evening. Several soldiers and two civilians were killed in the battles.</p>

<p>In the spring and summer of 1945, the division of ownership began in Veszprém County. In October 1948, the Land Office of Veszprém County called on the council to complete the land reform.</p>

<p>During the 1956 revolution, there were no more significant events in the village. “Following the defeat of the revolution, the Hungarian Socialist Workers&rsquo; Party - its agricultural policy announced in July 1957 - adopted a decision to further organize the farming cooperative movement. [&hellip;] The final turn took place on 22 February 1959. [&hellip;] The agricultural cooperative was named &gt;Concentrate&lt; TSZ and operated from 22 February 1959 until 31 August 1960. [&hellip;] On 29 August 1960 - three small agricultural cooperatives of three surrounding villages united: the Balatonszőlős Consent Tsz, Balatonfüred Kisfaludy Tsz and Balatonarács Lóczy Lajos Tsz. The new name of the merger is Balatonfüred Kisfaludy Mgtsz.”</p>

<p>According to the order issued on 1 January 1963 by the Presidential Council of the Hungarian People&rsquo;s Republic, a joint municipal council was organized for the municipalities of Balatonfüred and Balatonszőlős - with its headquarters in Balatonfüred. On July 13, 1963, a decision was made to establish a World Cup office in Balatonszőlős. After 1971, he became a city of Balatonfüred, he became under the direction of the common municipal council of Pécsely. In vineyard, the World Cup office remained.</p>

<p>December 2, 1982 was once again a milestone in the history of the village. The general meeting of the Balatonfüred Jókai Mgtsz stated that it will unite with the new name Nemesvámos-Csopak Tája MGTSZ - Nemesvámos-Balatonfüred Tája Mgtsz.</p>

<h2 id="school-and-teaching">School and teaching</h2>

<p>The year 1770 brought a significant change in the life of the village. The first (Reformed) teacher arrived in the person of Samuel Tokaji, who taught the village children writing, reading and some arithmetic. Until 1863 there was no Catholic school in the village, so they were also taught by the Calvinist pastor (or the parents did not send the child to school).</p>

<p>On December 1, 1907 the ceremony of the new (Calvinist) school of the village took place. From the 1930s, two religious elementary schools (Calvinist and Roman Catholic) operating in the village were merged. From that time until 1948, it operated as an undivided school with a teacher, only the study group was divided into religious classes.</p>

<p>The nationalization of the school was started in 1948, and on 9 March 1950 the National Committee signed the minutes. At school, apart from a short period, only junior students were educated.</p>

<p>1974 is another turning point in the history of the school and the Szőlős. On 16 December 1974, the primary school of Balatonszőlős will be permanently vacated because, according to the district process, students of the lower grades will continue their studies in Pécsely.</p>

<h2 id="system-change-and-subsequent-period">System change and subsequent period</h2>

<p>In 1990, Balatonszőlős became a self-governing municipality again. At the municipal elections held on 30 September 1990, Lajos Nagy elected an agrarian as the first man of the community.</p>

<p>The most important step in 1991 was to start the supply of healthy water to the village, that is to say, the preparation and implementation of the construction of the pipeline water system, which was realized in 1992.</p>

<p>In 1992, the Land Organizing Committee was established in the village, which was chaired by Lajos Nagy as mayor. The first auction took place on 26 October 1992 in Vynov.</p>

<p>The last time the municipality opened a new street opposite the Catholic cemetery in 1992, according to the request of the residents. In the summer of 2004, the municipality opens another street, which was named Fűzfa utca.</p>

<p>In August 1992, there was again a significant change in the life of the village. On the basis of Decree No <sup>51</sup>&frasl;<sub>92</sub>, the post of mayor will be held by the chief man of the village.</p>

<p>In 2000, the construction of the sewage system in the village began. Since the summer of 2003 it is possible to connect to the sewage system in the settlement.</p>

<p>In the 2002 municipal elections, Lajos Nagy, due to his retirement, refused to continue to perform the position he had held for twelve years. András Nagy was elected an independent candidate from several candidates, with a large majority.</p>

<p>In December 2003, the representative body dissolved itself at the request of the mayor. In the re-election, András Nagy won again, but the composition of the council changed. A new deputy mayor was welcomed by new faces appeared among the members of the village and the representative body.</p>
